We live in a world where our screen on time exceeds 10 hours a day every day.
We spend most of our time in front of our laptop or desktop. If you sit for long
periods each day working on a computer, you may be at risk for developing
physical strain and overuse injuries. It could result in excessive back pain. We
want to create a solution for this problem by creating a web application that
calibrates our posture with the help of 2 buttons. It would enable us to work for
long hours with less to worry.

As programmers, it’s our job to be at our computer for extended periods of time.
And, if you’re anything like us, the longer you sit there, the worse your posture
becomes. Without even realizing it, you begin to extend your neck, bringing
your face closer to the screen. You hunch your shoulders forward and slump in
your chair.

As well intentioned as we may be at the beginning of our work day, it’s easy to forget about our posture. Unfortunately, poor posture can lead to poor spine health and a litany of unrelenting neck and back pain. These issues are compounded by serious muscle, disc, and joint problems. In addition to chronic neck and back pain, these spinal changes can lead to headaches, fatigue, respiratory issues, and even damage to some of your major organs, which may impact bodily functions, such as bowel and bladder control.
<b>We want to build an application which uses TensorFlow to estimate your posture while siting Infront of the system for long duration.</b>
